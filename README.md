# React Stuff
This is a repo about React stuff that I use to explore powerful things and limits of the `coolest` library.

## Requirements:
* NodeJS [learn more](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* `npm` [learn more](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
* `npx` package runner [learn more](https://nodejs.dev/learn/the-npx-nodejs-package-runner)
* `yarn` [learn more](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)

## Additional libraries
* Styled Components [learn more](https://styled-components.com/)
* Material-UI [learn more](https://material-ui.com/getting-started/installation/)

## Installation
* [Clone](https://git-scm.com/book/it/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository) the project into your local environment
* Run `yarn` command inside the main project directory to install all the dependencies

## Using yarn to run the app

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Create a React App from scratch
If you want to create a React from scratch, just run:
```
npx create-react-app your-new-app
```
If you already are in the folder you want to use, run:
```
npx create-react-app .
```
